    Args:
        fpath (str): path to file to be parsed.
        ftype (:obj:`str`, optional): file type (PDB or mmCIF). `None` defaults
            to guessing the file type from the extension.

    Returns:
        :obj:`Structure`: new instance of `Structure` class defining a topology
            and positions for the input structure.

    Raises:
        StructureError: generic error class for problems during structure parsing
            or conversion with OpenMM.
