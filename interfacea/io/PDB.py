    """Yet another PDB Parser.

    This variation of a PDB format parser does not read lines other than
    coordinate information (ATOM, HETATM, MODEL, ENDMODEL) and stops reading
    when an 'END' record is found. Like pretty much 99.9% of other PDB parsers
    out there.

    Args:
        filepath (str): path to the PDB file to be read.
        permissive (bool, optional): ignores mal-formatted records in the PDB
            file if set to True. Defaults to False.
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: if the input file cannot be read.
        PDBFormatError: if a record line cannot be parsed correctly.
        PDBFormatWarning: if PDBFormatError is raised on an ATOM/HETATM line
            but permissive it set to True.
