    Parameters
    ----------
        level : str
            Verbosity of logging. Choose from minimal, verbose, or debug. The
            default setting is not to setup any logging. You have to call this
            function explicitly to see messages other than warnings or errors.

    Raises
    ------
        ValueError
            The logging level you provided is not supported.
