    """Class to infer atom connectivity from cartesian coordinates.

    Args:
        structure (Structure): atomic structure with coordinate and metadata.

    Attributes:
        tolerance (float): factor to account for variations in bond lengths.
            Set to 0.45 by default, lower means a more strict criterion to
            consider two atoms bonded.
        ignore (list): atomic numbers to ignore when accounting for bonding.
            By default, contains all metallic elements.

    Returns:
        List of 2-item tuples with Atoms involved in a bond.
